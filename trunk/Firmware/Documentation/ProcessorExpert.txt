Module "I2C2"      (component InternalI2C)
   - I2C2_SendChar -When working as a MASTER, this method writes one (7-bit addressing) or two (10-bit addressing) slave 
                address bytes inclusive of R/W bit = 0 to the I2C bus and then writes one character (byte) to the bus. The 
                slave address must be specified before, by the "SelectSlave" or "SelectSlave10" method or in the component 
                initialization section, "Target slave address init" property. If interrupt service is enabled and the method 
                returns ERR_OK, it doesn't mean that transmission was successful. The state of transmission is obtainable from 
                (OnTransmitData, OnError or OnArbitLost) events.   When working as a SLAVE, this method writes a character to 
                the internal output slave buffer and, after the master starts the communication, to the I2C bus. If no 
                character is ready for a transmission (internal output slave buffer is empty), the Empty character will be sent 
                (see "Empty character" property).
   - I2C2_RecvChar -When working as a MASTER, this method writes one (7-bit addressing) or two (10-bit addressing) slave 
                address bytes inclusive of R/W bit = 1 to the I2C bus, then reads one character (byte) from the bus and then 
                sends the stop condition. The slave address must be specified before, by the "SelectSlave" or "SelectSlave10" 
                method or in component initialization section, property "Target slave address init". If interrupt service is 
                enabled and the method returns ERR_OK, it doesn't mean that transmission was finished successfully. The state 
                of transmission must be tested by means of events (OnReceiveData, OnError or OnArbitLost). In case of 
                successful transmission, received data is ready after OnReceiveData event is called.   When working as a SLAVE, 
                this method reads a character from the input slave buffer.
   - I2C2_SendBlock -When working as a MASTER, this method writes one (7-bit addressing) or two (10-bit addressing) slave 
                address bytes inclusive of R/W bit = 0 to the I2C bus and then writes the block of characters to the bus. The 
                slave address must be specified before, by the "SelectSlave" or "SlaveSelect10" method or in component 
                initialization section, "Target slave address init" property. If interrupt service is enabled and the method 
                returns ERR_OK, it doesn't mean that transmission was successful. The state of transmission is detectable by 
                means of events (OnTransmitData, OnError or OnArbitLost). Data to be send is not copied to an internal buffer 
                and remains in the original location. Therefore the content of the buffer should not be changed until the 
                transmission is complete. Event OnTransmitData can be used to detect the end of the transmission.  When working 
                as a SLAVE, this method writes a block of characters to the internal output slave buffer and then, after the 
                master starts the communication, to the I2C bus. If no character is ready for a transmission (internal output 
                slave buffer is empty), the "Empty character" will be sent (see "Empty character" property). In SLAVE mode the 
                data are copied to an internal buffer, if specified by "Output buffer size" property.
   - I2C2_RecvBlock -When working as a MASTER, this method writes one (7-bit addressing) or two (10-bit addressing) slave 
                address bytes inclusive of R/W bit = 1 to the I2C bus, then reads the block of characters from the bus and then 
                sends the stop condition. The slave address must be specified before, by the "SelectSlave" or "SelectSlave10" 
                method or in component initialization section, "Target slave address init" property. If interrupt service is 
                enabled and the method returns ERR_OK, it doesn't mean that transmission was finished successfully. The state 
                of transmission must be tested by means of events (OnReceiveData, OnError or OnArbitLost). In case of 
                successful transmission, received data is ready after OnReceiveData event is called.   When working as a SLAVE, 
                this method reads a block of characters from the input slave buffer.
   - I2C2_GetCharsInTxBuf -Returns number of characters in the output buffer. In SLAVE mode returns the number of characters in 
                the internal slave output buffer. In MASTER mode returns number of characters to be sent from the user buffer 
                (passed by SendBlock method).  This method is not supported in polling mode.
   - I2C2_GetCharsInRxBuf -Returns number of characters in the input buffer. In SLAVE mode returns the number of characters in 
                the internal slave input buffer. In MASTER mode returns number of characters to be received into a user buffer 
                (passed by RecvChar or RecvBlock method).   This method is not supported in polling mode.
   - I2C2_SelectSlave -This method selects a new slave for communication by its 7-bit slave address value. Any send or receive 
                method directs to or from selected device, until a new slave device is selected by this method. This method is 
                not available for the SLAVE mode.

Module "AS1"       (component AsynchroSerial)
   - AS1_RecvChar -If any data is received, this method returns one character, otherwise it returns an error code (it does not 
                wait for data). This method is enabled only if the receiver property is enabled.  [Note:] Because the preferred 
                method to handle error and break exception in the interrupt mode is to use events <OnError> and <OnBreak> the 
                return value ERR_RXEMPTY has higher priority than other error codes. As a consequence the information about an 
                exception in interrupt mode is returned only if there is a valid character ready to be read. [ Version specific 
                information for Freescale 56800 derivatives ]   DMA mode:  If DMA controller is available on the selected CPU 
                and the receiver is configured to use DMA controller then this method only sets the selected DMA channel. Then 
                the status of the DMA transfer can be checked using GetCharsInRxBuf method. See an example of a typical usage 
                for details about the communication using DMA.
   - AS1_SendChar -Sends one character to the channel. If the component is temporarily disabled (Disable method) SendChar 
                method only stores data into an output buffer. In case of a zero output buffer size, only one character can be 
                stored. Enabling the component (Enable method) starts the transmission of the stored data. This method is 
                available only if the transmitter property is enabled.  [ Version specific information for Freescale 56800 
                derivatives ]   DMA mode:  If DMA controller is available on the selected CPU and the transmitter is configured 
                to use DMA controller then this method only sets selected DMA channel. Then the status of the DMA transfer can 
                be checked using GetCharsInTxBuf method. See an example of a typical usage for details about communication 
                using DMA.
   - AS1_GetCharsInRxBuf -Returns the number of characters in the input buffer. This method is available only if the receiver 
                property is enabled. [ Version specific information for Freescale 56800 derivatives ]   DMA mode:  If DMA 
                controller is available on the selected CPU and the receiver is configured to use DMA controller then this 
                method returns the number of characters in the receive buffer.
   - AS1_GetCharsInTxBuf -Returns the number of characters in the output buffer. This method is available only if the 
                transmitter property is enabled. [ Version specific information for Freescale 56800 derivatives ]   DMA mode:  
                If DMA controller is available on the selected CPU and the transmitter is configured to use DMA controller then 
                this method returns the number of characters in the transmit buffer.

Module "SM1"       (component SynchroMaster)
   - SM1_RecvChar -If any data is received, this method returns one character, otherwise it returns an error code (it does not 
                wait for data).   For information about SW overrun behavior please see <General info page>. [ Version specific 
                information for Freescale 56800 derivatives ]   DMA mode:  If DMA controller is available on selected CPU and 
                receiver is configured to use DMA controller then this method only sets the selected DMA channel. Status of the 
                DMA transfer can then be checked using method GetCharsInRxBuf. See typical usage for details about 
                communication using DMA.
   - SM1_SendChar -Sends one character to the channel. [ Version specific information for Freescale 56800 derivatives ]   DMA 
                mode:  If DMA controller is available on the selected CPU and the transmitter is configured to use DMA 
                controller then this method only sets the selected DMA channel. The status of the DMA transfer can then be 
                checked using GetCharsInTxBuf method. See the typical usage for details about communication using DMA.
   - SM1_GetCharsInRxBuf -Returns the number of characters in the input buffer.  Note: If the Interrupt service is disabled, 
                and the Ignore empty character is set to yes, and a character has been received, then this method returns 1 
                although it was an empty character. [ Version specific information for Freescale 56800 derivatives ]   DMA mode:
                If DMA controller is available on the selected CPU and the receiver is configured to use DMA controller then 
                this method returns the number of characters in the receive buffer.
   - SM1_GetCharsInTxBuf -Returns the number of characters in the output buffer. [ Version specific information for Freescale 
                56800 derivatives ]   DMA mode:  If DMA controller is available on the selected CPU and the transmitter is 
                configured to use DMA controller then this method returns the number of characters in the transmit buffer.
   - SM1_GetError -Returns a set of errors on the channel (errors that cannot be returned in given methods). The component 
                accumulates errors in a set; after calling [GetError] this set is returned and cleared. This method is 
                available only if the "Interrupt service/event" property is enabled.
